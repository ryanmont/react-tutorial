  Which airport is closest to the venue?
  <br />
  <span> SLC International is the largest airport and will have the most flight options.  The Provo Municipal airport is much closer, but flights to Provo are limited. </span>
<br />
<br />

  What's the best option for transportation to the Venue?
  <br />
  <span> If you're traveling from the SLC airport, you can ride TRAX to the Frontrunner, which is a very clean train that runs all the way to Provo. It will cost roughly $6.10 to go from SLC to Provo one way.  The event center and surrounding hotels are about a mile away from the station, so a ride-sharing service like Uber or Lyft would average about $6-$8 to get you to your hotel.  If you prefer to have a direct ride to your hotel from the SLC airport it will average about $88 one way. An express shuttle is $45 one way and a taxis is about $100 one way.  A ride sharing service is your best option for transportation from the Provo airport and will average $9.</span>
